1- Specify the missing files at pyinstaller command

> pyinstaller --hidden-import=pkg_resources.py2_warn --hidden-import=pkg_resources.markers
	-- If error persists, add --clean option
	-- If error persists, delete second parameter "--hidden-import=pkg_resources.markers"

2- Don't use the one file option

3- Completely copy the package(s)(for me it was Lib\site-packages\plotly) for the python installation directory into the /dist/{exe name}/ directory, if there are any pointed out at the console
