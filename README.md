Want to know where is the International Space Station (ISS) currently? Here is a small python script which will enable you to see the exact location of ISS.

## What is ISS
The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada).[1][2] The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements.[3] The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields.[4][5][6] The ISS is suited for testing the spacecraft systems and equipment required for possible future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.[7]
